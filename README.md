Train a model for deep hallucination classification. This is a multi-way classification task in which an image must be classified into one of the 96 classes.

The training data is composed of 12,000 image files. The validation set is composed of 1,000 image files. The test is composed of 5,000 image files.

For classification I used KNN and CNN. I have explained the whole process in the documentation.
